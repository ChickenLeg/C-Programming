# Status
This assignment consists of designing and building a set of programs: a des_display as a server, a des_inputs and a des_controller as clients to simulate a building entry controller system and provide a testing harness. The system is designed as a two door system with card scanners on each door, a scale that weighs the person after they have entered the space between the two doors, and a human guard that uses a switch to open each of the doors.
